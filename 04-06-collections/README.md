# Days 04-06: Collections Module

Provides different types of containers.

*A container is an object that is used to store different objects and provide a way to access the contained objects and iterate over them*

## Day N: Your new data structure friend

Today I will learn about some powerful new data structures:

## Day N+1: Practice using Abstract Base Class (abc)

The collections module has some concrete classes that derive from ABCs; these can, of course, be further derived. In addition, the collections.abc submodule has some ABCs that can be used to test whether a class or instance provides a particular interface, for example, if it is hashable or if it is a mapping.

The key purpose of the abstract class is to check whether an object conforms to a particular protocol.  It is a valuable class for testing certain attributes of a class or testing class itself. 

However, there are many other things that the abstract class does not check. Some of them are signatures, return type, etc. 

Advantage: It provides a flexible way for developers to test common types of collections.
 
## Day N+2: Tried using movie data

I get to use these new data structures.

Let's import it here to see some of our newly learned collections data types in action.

Trying to use it in a simple manner!
