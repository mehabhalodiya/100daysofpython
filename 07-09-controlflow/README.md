# Days 07-09: Control Flow Tools

In the programs, there has always been a series of statements faithfully executed by Python in exact top-down order. What if you wanted to change the flow of how it works? 

For example, you want the program to take some decisions and do different things depending on different situations, such as printing 'Good Morning' or 'Good Evening' depending on the time of the day?

This is achieved using control flow statements. There are three control flow statements in Python - if, for and while.

## Day N: Learn the basics 

Python uses the usual flow control statements known from other languages, with some twists.
So, once go through that.

Further, learn more on defining functions with default argument values, keyword arguments, special parameters i.e. positional-or-keyword arguments, positional-only parameters and keyword-only arguments.

## Day N+1: Taking a deep dive

Lambda expressions - also known as “anonymous functions” - allow you to create and use a function in a single line.  They are useful when you need a short function that you will only use once i.e. when using the map, filter and sort methods.

Lastly, refer json for implementing.

## Day N+2: Time to create

"The Anagram Game"

The in-built module random will be helpful in implementing this project.

Concepts: Console Input/Output, Strings, File Handling, Conditional & Control Flow
