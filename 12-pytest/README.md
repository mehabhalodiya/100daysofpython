## Day 12: Test your code with pytest

`pytest` is a framework that makes building simple and scalable tests easy. Tests are expressive and readableâ€”no boilerplate code required.

Initially, I started TDD or _test driven development_ in action by implementing _Fizz Buzz_ by writing the tests first, in small incremental steps. I have learned about the `pytest.mark.parametrize` decorator to elegantly handle repetitive tests.

Finally, I use `pytest` to test a simple guessing game. It might not be the easiest example for a beginner, but it allows me to show some real world issues you want to address in your test code. 

I tried how to write a test with `pytest` and how it differs from the classic (more verbose) `unittest` syntax.

Be warned: mastering `pytest` might feel like possessing a super power!
